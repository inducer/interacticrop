#InteractiCrop

Steal figures from other people's slide PDFs, in vector form, easily.

Quick instructions:

* Run as `interacticrop some-slide-deck.pdf 15`.
* A window will pop up.
* You click twice, indicating the area you'd like cropped out, in no particular order.
* You get output like this:
  ```latex
  \includegraphics[
    viewport=10.89cm 3.62cm 24.19cm 11.52cm,clip=true,page=8
    ]{some-slide-deck.pdf}
  ```

* You copy that line to your LaTeX source and life is good.
* Optional: You specify `-o out.pdf` and a cropped output PDF is also written for you.

**OBVIOUSLY:** Don't forget to credit the folks that you steal from! Here's a bonus LaTeX+TikZ macro
to do that:

```latex
\newcommand{\creditto}[1]{
  \begin{tikzpicture}[overlay]
    \node [xshift=1cm,yshift=0.5cm]
      at (current page.south west)
      [font=\scriptsize,fill=gray!30,anchor=south west,opacity=0.5]
      {#1};
  \end{tikzpicture}
}
```

Dependencies:

* [poppler-python](https://launchpad.net/poppler-python)
* [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/)
* [PyPDF2](https://github.com/knowah/PyPDF2) (optional, if you'd like cropped output)
* [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org)

Just run these commands, perhaps with `sudo`:

* `aptitude install libpoppler-cpp-dev`
* `pip install python-poppler pillow matplotlib`
* `pip install http://github.com/knowah/PyPDF2/tarball/master` (optional)

Not using Linux, where installing this stuff is easy? I'm sure there's someone
on your friendly neighborhood app store ready to take your money.
